       Hey Moon,
Do you know I really like this girl? Things are going pretty fine, and I just want to let you know that even though we can't see each other every day, you are watching both of us. You are the connection between us; you are an important part of my life. Since the day I met her, I can't forget about you or her hand, and how her hand made me feel—how her presence made me feel at ease, how she comforted me at the time I needed her most, how she flutters my heart, how she motivates me to do things in my life that I was afraid to do. But I want to do everything I can. I want to become the person that I know she deserves, and there are so many things I want to tell you—but I think she is listening to us.
